# LED Brightness Control using Push Buttons (Arduino Project)

A simple Arduino project to control the brightness of an LED using two push buttons. One increases brightness, the other decreases it using PWM (analogWrite).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Digital input (buttons)
- PWM control using analogWrite
- Embedded logic with Arduino C++
- Real-world circuit building and testing

## Components Used
- Aurdino UNO
- 1 LED
- 2 Push Buttons
- 2x 10k&Omega; resistors
- 1 220&Omega; resistor for LED
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Circuit Summary
- Button 1 (D7) : Increases brightness
- Button 2 (D6) : Decreases brightness
- LED on pin D3 (PWM)
- Resistors act as pull-ups

## Code
See 'led_brightness_control.ion' in this reposistory.
